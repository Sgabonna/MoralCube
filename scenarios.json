The policy also produced major negative effects—developmental delays in children, increased substance abuse, worsened mental health, and postponed elective treatments. These harms can be deep and long‐lasting, potentially offsetting or surpassing the benefits of infection control. A utilitarian’s judgment heavily depends on empirical data about the number of lives saved versus the severity and duration of the negative impacts."

Initially, it appeared to maximize well-being by saving lives from malaria. However, the long-term environmental damage and potential risks to human health complicate this calculation. A negative utilitarian perspective would emphasize the significant increase in suffering caused by the environmental consequences. The ethical justification depends on a comprehensive assessment of all the costs and benefits, both present and future, which is a difficult ethical calculation."

While the initial motivation might have been virtuous (compassion for those suffering from malaria), the failure to anticipate and adequately assess the long-term consequences suggests a lack of practical wisdom (*phronesis*).  The case also underscores the need for intellectual humility, acknowledging the limits of our knowledge and the potential for unintended consequences."
