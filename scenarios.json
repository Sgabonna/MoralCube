From a negative utilitarian perspective, the aim was to minimize suffering from the pandemic, but the measures themselves introduced new forms of suffering, making the net reduction of suffering debatable and thus ambiguous."

"description": "Overview: During the initial rollout of the Salk polio vaccine in the United States, Cutter Laboratories produced vaccine batches that accidentally contained live poliovirus. Motivation: The overriding goal was to rapidly protect children from polio (clearly altruistic), but manufacturing oversights led to around 40,000 infections, with hundreds of cases of paralysis and several deaths. Key Point: The altruistic drive to conquer polio collided with inadequate quality control, causing tragic consequences.",

The action decreased net happiness in society.\n\nFrom a negative utilitarian view focused on minimizing suffering, the action is even more clearly wrong. The attacker directly created suffering where none existed before—inflicting pain, fear, and trauma on innocent people. The security guards' injuries, the bystanders' distress, and the societal harm from public violence all represent unnecessary suffering introduced into the world. Even if the attacker was attempting to alleviate personal distress through violence, this approach multiplied rather than reduced overall suffering."

The attacker failed to find the mean between extremes, falling into vicious excess of aggression and complete deficiency of self-restraint."
